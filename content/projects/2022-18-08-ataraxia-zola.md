The aim of this project is to search for pulsating white dwarfs with hydrogen atmosphere at
hotter temperatures, i.e. 30 000 K. The pulsation in those stars were proposed by Shibahashi
(2005, 2007) and for the first time observed by Kurtz et al. 2008. Later on, Romero et al.
2020 confirmed the existence of the new pulsating class of hot DA white dwarf stars.
