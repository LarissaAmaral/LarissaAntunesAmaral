This research project proposes a refined search for ELM progenitors.
Building on the foundational work of Nelemans+01 and exploring the potential role of recently-detached cataclysmic variables (CVs) in ELM progenitor scenarios (Sun & Arras 2018), the study places the investigation of detached ELMs within the broader context of ultracompact binaries, thermonuclear supernovae, and their relevance to LISA signals.
Recent advancements, notably the ZTF survey conducted by El-Badry et al. in 2021, have significantly expanded our knowledge of evolved CV populations, providing a valuable resource for improving the understanding of compact binary systems.
To advance this exploration, the project proposes a refined search for ELM progenitors. This involves a cross-match between Gaia and existing TESS satellite light curves, with the goal of enhancing observational input and contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the compact binary population.
Motivated by a deep curiosity about the universe's intricacies, the project team is committed to leveraging observational techniques and available data to unravel the mysteries behind ELMs, ultimately advancing our understanding of the cosmos.
