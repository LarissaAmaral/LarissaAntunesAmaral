We report the detection of periodic variations on the Teff≃32000 K DA white dwarf star HE 1017-1352. We obtained time series photometry using the 4.1-m Southern Astrophysical Research telescope on three separate nights for a total of 16.8 h. From the frequency analysis, we found four periods of 605, 556, 508, and 869 s with significant amplitudes above the 1/1000 false alarm probability detection limit. The detected modes are compatible with low harmonic degree g-mode non-radial pulsations with radial order higher than ∼9. This detection confirms the pulsation nature of HE 1017-1352 and thus the existence of the new pulsating class of hot DA white dwarf stars. In addition, we detect a long period of 1.52 h, compatible with a rotation period of DA white dwarf stars.    [Read it complete here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01008.pdf).
