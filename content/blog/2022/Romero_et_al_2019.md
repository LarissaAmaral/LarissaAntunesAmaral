We perform ground-based photometric observations of 22 DA white dwarf stars, 10 already known ZZ Cetis and 12 candidates with atmospheric parameters inside the classical instability strip. We report on the discovery of four new variable DA white dwarf stars. Two objects are near the middle of the instability strip, SDSS J082804.63+094956.6 and SDSS J094929.09+101918.8, and two red edge pulsators, GD 195 and L495-82. In addition, we classified four objects as possible variables, since evidence of variability was detected in the light curve, but the signal-to-noise ratio was not sufficient to establish a definite detection. Follow-up observations were performed for 10 known ZZ Ceti stars to verify period stability and search for new periodicities. For each confirmed variable, we perform a detailed asteroseismological fit and compare the structural parameters obtained from the best-fitting models with those obtained from spectroscopy and photometry from Gaia. Finally we present a study of the asteroseismological properties of a sample of 91 ZZ Ceti stars.   [Read it complete here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05555.pdf).
