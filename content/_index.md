##### Hi there üëã I'm Larissa. 
an astrophysicist hailing from South of Brazil. My academic journey led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Physics with an emphasis on astrophysics. Currently, I find myself in the final year of my Ph.D. in astrophysics at the Universidad de Valpara√≠so, Chile.  


On my research odyssey, I am working with big surveys of data of stars, with a primary quest of unveiling the secrets hidden in the variability of white dwarf stars. During my bachelor, I've worked with pulsating white dwarf stars with hydrogen atmosphere. Meaning, dead stars exhibiting vibrations, like quakes.  
During my Ph.D., I've set my sights on a particularly intriguing celestial species ‚Äì the extremely-low mass white dwarf stars, also known as ELMs. With masses smaller than 0.3 solar masses, these stars defy cosmic norms as they have to be born from binary systems. Otherwise they would be older than the age of the Universe!  

I possess a diverse skill set that goes beyond astronomy, encompassing a strong foundation in time series analysis and a keen ability to leverage Big Data for profound astronomical insights. My research background is centered on the translation of complex datasets into actionable insights. Specializing in extracting meaningful information from extensive datasets, I excel in employing advanced statistical methods and utilizing Python for efficient data analysis and visualization. Proficient in Python programming, Linux, LaTeX, and Anaconda. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge effectively to contribute to data-centric projects in a dynamic work environment.  


However, my professional profile extends beyond the realm of data points and algorithms. Thriving in collaborative pursuits, I am adept at assuming leadership roles in projects, seamlessly integrating experiences into the fabric of meetings and conferences. I firmly believe in the power of communication, advocate for equal rights, and cherish the magic that a pleasant and collaborative environment brings to scientific exploration.
